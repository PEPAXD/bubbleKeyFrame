## Description

BubbleKeyframe is a project that displays a dynamic bubble animation on a web page. These bubbles float in the background and create an attractive visual effect.

## How It Works

The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the bubble animation. Here's how it works:

- Colorful bubbles are dynamically generated in the background of the page.
- Each bubble has a CSS animation that gives it an up-and-down motion.
- The animation repeats infinitely, creating a continuous floating bubbles effect.

## How to Use

1. Open the HTML file in your browser to see the bubble animation.
2. Watch as the bubbles float in the background of the page.

## Technologies Used
